# Voron V2.4 Build Log

Ah...where do I begin?

At the time of this writing, I have already built the VORON V2.4 printer.  However, there are several issues that I face.  As my main printer, these problems really  bothers me so much that I am building an Annex K3 printer.

## Problems

1. **Speed**.  I enjoy prototyping and faster iteration always helps.  My VORON v2.4 can barely speed up to 250mm/s with 10K acceleration, without loosing quality.  This is very reasonable as V2.4 is not meant to be a speed printer.  Considering the toolhead & X gantry weight, the belt length, it is pretty hard to push the machine faster.  

2. **Damn Cable Chains**.  Cable chain has been a PITA during the build and maintainence on my V2.4.  If given the chance I would build it with Umbilical wiring.
 
3. **Gantry Squareness & Belting**.  Deracking the V2.4 requires 4 Z on the same height & ideally QGL-ed to the build plate, AND perfectly belting two belts to the same tension.  Most of the CoreXY printer would have this problem.  This doesn't cause a lot of trouble once it's squared and deracked, but it is a painful process to build and it makes me less willing to take down & modify the gantry once it's built.

4. **Electronics Access**.  All VORON printers put the electronics on the bottom of the machine.  It's very painful to flip the machine just to unplug & plug something.
 
4. **Official support for the Slice Mosquito hotend**.  This is a highly controversy topic.  But I personally really like the Mosquito hotend (shrug)
