
## Planning & Parts Preparation

There is no official "build guide" for Annex K3.  I will be follow the e-drawing and the [build order provided by ActualVarner#5006](https://discord.com/channels/641407187004030997/852302000834084924/916480019998584843).  This section will be slowly removed as the build goes on.

### Printed Parts

With the 3DXTech ASA, I'm using the following setting to print the parts.

| Setting  | Value |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| Temperature | 260c Hotend, 105c Bed  |
| Infill  | 40% Grid |
| Shells | 4 Perimeters, 5 top/bottom |

### Rails & Bearings

I printed the [Bearing Repacker](https://github.com/Annex-Engineering/Misc_Designs/tree/master/Bearing_Repacker).  But after examining the Fabreeko bearings, they are decently lubricated :)  

Fabreeko Rails are also lubed with EP2.  The preload is higher so I run the rails back and forth rapidly to break it in a bit.

### Panels 

> TBD
