The toolhead is packed with details and there are a lot of variants.  For this build log, I'm building:

| Toolhead Item | Choice | 
| ------------- | ------------- | 
| Extruder | Sherpa Mini | 
| Hotend | Slice Mosquito (Magnum) | 
| Hotend Mounting | [Mosquito Net](https://github.com/Annex-Engineering/Gasherbrum-K3/tree/main/Release_1_1/Experimental/K3_mosquito_net_RC1) | 
| Party Plate Material | PC-CF |
