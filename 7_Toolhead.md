## Toolhead

> "Hold up, we are not done with Z assembly!" well, to streamline the build I think belting up Z can go with bed assembly, which is probably the next chapter.

The toolhead is packed with details and there are a lot of variants.  For this build log, I'm building:

| Toolhead Item | Choice | 
| ------------- | ------------- | 
| Extruder | Sherpa Mini | 
| Hotend | Slice Mosquito Magnum | 
| Hotend Mounting | [Mosquito Net](https://github.com/Annex-Engineering/Gasherbrum-K3/tree/main/Release_1_1/Experimental/K3_mosquito_net_RC1) | 
| Printed Parts Material | PC-CF |
| Wiring | Just Microfit-3 (No K3rabiner) |


### Sherpa Mini

Compare to other extruders I've built in the past, the Sherpa Mini is a simple yet elegant design.  To avoid confusion and provide the most up to date information, please follow the official [Sherpa Build Instruction](https://github.com/Annex-Engineering/Sherpa_Mini-Extruder/tree/master/Build_Instructions).

We can see that the front piece is different, there's an additional mounting hole.  This is to provide extra rigidity when mounting to the main  toolhead body (aka party plate). 

I recommend using the [Bondtech internal set for Sherpa Mini](https://www.bondtech.se/product/bmg-internals-set-for-sherpa-mini/).  This set does not require grinding the main shaft, and comes with all the screws necessary.  

Some additional notes:

1. VC-3 all the screws!
2. Make sure to clean up the filament path with a 2mm drill bit.
