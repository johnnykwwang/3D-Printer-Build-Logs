# Annex K3 Build Log
A personal build log of the Annex K3 printer. 

## Preface & Disclaimer
This is a personal build log of the [Annex K3](https://github.com/Annex-Engineering/Gasherbrum-K3) printer.  At the time of this writing, [K3 is at RC1 stage](https://github.com/Annex-Engineering/Gasherbrum-K3/releases/tag/R1RC1).  It is very likely that some components or parts of the build already changed.  

**This should not be considered as a build guide.  Please refer to the e-drawing and the K3 repo for more up-to-date info.**

I will try to document more details during the build.  From sourcing, printing parts, component preparation, building, wiring, and so on.  I will also point out any modifications I made to the printer.  As all DIY printesr, this machine would likely not going to be a "stock" machine.

If there's any feedback, feel free to find me at the Annex Discord, or ping jkwang#7099.

## Why K3

Why not?

Looking at the K3,  I found that the design addressed most of the problems I have with the VORON V2.4.   More importantly, I really like the Annex design philisophy: Printer with amazing performance and ease of maintenance.
