## XY Gantry Assembly

### Motor mounts

This is pretty straightforward.  Mount the motor to the motor plate first, then mount them to the top of frame.  I'm using the LDO-42STH48-2004MAH "long bois" motors.  For the "couplers" motors the approach might be different.

Fasteners: 16x `M3x10 SHCS`, 12x `M5x10 SHCS`, 8x M5 t-nut.
