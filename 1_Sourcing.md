> Note:  By the time you read this, the K3 BOM is likely updated.  Please refer to the latest BOM!

This is a log of what component I chose in the build and why.  

### Kits

I got a lot of parts kit from [Fabreeko](https://www.fabreeko.com/).  This helps a lot with sourcing the K3 as I don't have to hunt down each bearings, pulley and idlers.

| Component / Item | What I got | Notes |
| ------------- | ------------- | ------------- |
| Frame  | LDO K3 Frame |  |
| Motors  | LDO K3 Motors |  |
| Linear Rails  | HoneyBadger K3 Rails |  |
| Bearings Kit  | HoneyBadger Chrome Steel Bearings |  |
| Motion Kit  | Fabreeko's K3 Motion Kit |  |

Below are parts that are not covered by the kits.

### Printed Parts

I used 3DXTECH ASA Black and Grey for the parts. 

### Structural

I went with all the recommended bracket from Misumi, including the internal L bracket.  

| Component / Item | What I got | Notes |
| ------------- | ------------- | ------------- |
| Internal L Bracket - 2020 Extrusion  | HBLPBS5 | ...this hurts my wallet. |

Following some popular build on Discord, I decided to order MCPC-X cable sleeve as well.
