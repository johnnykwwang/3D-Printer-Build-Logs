## Frame Assembly
### Prep Work
1. To assemble the frame, I managed to find a 16"x16" quartz countertop piece at a local shop.
2. I choose to use M5x12 instead of the M5x8(BOM) on blind joints.
3. Counting the screw number, and pre-apply VC3 [1] on all the screws. Following the wisdom from the Annex discord, I will apply VC3 to all the screws in the printer. 

> [1]: Vibra-tite VC3 requires pre-applying and waiting for it to dry.  [See product page](https://www.vibra-tite.com/threadlockers/removable-reusable-threadlockers/vibra-tite-vc-3-threadmate/)
