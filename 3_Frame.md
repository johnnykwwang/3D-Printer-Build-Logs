## Frame Assembly
### Prep Work
1. To assemble the frame, I managed to find a 16"x16" quartz countertop piece at a local shop.
2. I choose to use M5x12 instead of the M5x8(BOM) on blind joints.
3. Counting the screws needed, and pre-apply VC3 [1] on all the screws. I'm using VC3 to all the screws in the printer. 

> [1]: Vibra-tite VC3 requires pre-applying and waiting for it to dry.  [See product page](https://www.vibra-tite.com/threadlockers/removable-reusable-threadlockers/vibra-tite-vc-3-threadmate/)

### Assembly

At this step we're only assembling the main frame, excluding the crossbar and rear bracing for Z.  Note that it's easier to assemble the K3 frame upside down.

  <tr>
     <td> Putting 4 horizontal frame on the surface.  Attaching 4 frame corners.  Tighten slightly.</td>
     <td> <img width="500" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/13166286/171062954-b7a966c7-d8bf-46e8-a35f-346aaa6cf72d.png"> </td>
  </tr> 
  <tr>
     <td> Flip the frame and attach 4 bottom extrusions.  For these, we need 2cm space which we can use the remaining extrusions as a spacer.
       Remember to also attach the internal L bracket before sliding in.</td>

     </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>     
     <td> Square up the frame with machinest square, and tighten all screws.  It took me about 30-40 minutes to ensure the frame is squared.  I think Nero's video explains better.  </td>

     </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
